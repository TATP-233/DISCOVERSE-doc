# Basic Simulation Overview

Welcome to the DISCOVERSE Basic Simulation Tutorial! This tutorial will guide you through creating and running robot simulations in DISCOVERSE. DISCOVERSE is a high-fidelity robot simulation platform based on the MuJoCo physics engine and supports 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering technology.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Understand the configuration system and basic architecture of DISCOVERSE
- Create and configure robot simulation environments
- Use real robot models (such as AirbotPlay, MMK2)
- Configure sensors and rendering options
- Run basic robot operation tasks

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have:

- ‚ú?Completed the [Installation Guide](/docs/get-started/installation)
- ‚ú?Run the [Quick Start](/docs/get-started/quick-start)
- ‚ú?Read the [Basic Concepts](/docs/get-started/basic-concepts)

## üèóÔ∏?DISCOVERSE Architecture

DISCOVERSE is built on the following core technologies:

### MuJoCo Physics Engine
